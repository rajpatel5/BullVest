# BullVest

A stock market simulator app which offers videos to learn the basics of trading and terminology used by traders worldwide. It retrieves real-time data about the stocks such as market cap, price, P/E ratio from the web and also displays recently published articles. It also offers multiple trading options such as buying or selling at market price, setting a limit, stop loss, or stop limit, and the user has a "Hotlist" to help them decide which stock to invest in. An older version of this app is available on the Google Play store.

It is coded in Java using Android Studio. This project makes excellent use of threads, databases, API's, and much more. It also makes use of the fundamentals of the Andoid operating system such as services, intents, and notifications. It has a simple, yet effective UI created through the use of fragments, listviews and much more. The real-time data requires JSON parsing which the app successfully completes and it loads the data using cursorloaders. The user portfolio data is stored in a database for later use which requires SQLite.
